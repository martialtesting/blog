>"The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you’ll go."" ― Dr. Seuss, I Can Read With My Eyes Shut!

Hey, hello! How have you been? As you can see from the title in today’s post, I want to recommended you an author with whom I’ve learnt, and with whom I continue to learn.

You see, as I started in this challenging craft of software testing, it quickly dawn on me that despite my knowledge would help me to give value, I still had **A LOT TO LEARN**, and instead of bringing me down, that just ignited and fuelled me to go after what I considered would need to quench my thirst for knowledge.

Time has passed (a few years now), and luckily, I can still say that there’s **A LOT TO LEARN :)**

Some time ago, I purchased my very first book from [Gerald M. Weinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Weinberg), called ["Perfect Software and other illusions about testing"](https://leanpub.com/perfectsoftware). Let me tell you that this book is highly recommended, whether you are new to the craft of software testing, or even a seasoned tester, whatever the case, it’s a very interesting and educational piece of work.

As I read through the book, there were a few points in which I wouldn’t fully agree with Weinberg. nonetheless, the book quickly and easily exceeded my expectations, and it surely taught me several lessons.

Besides, the book is packed with a lot of interesting concepts, and on top of that, it is written in a way that makes you want to keep reading it, so I re-visit the book from time to time because I am dead certain I have yet neither learned, nor fully understood all of the concepts in it.

Recently have I acquired a new collection from the author, it is called the ["The Tester’s Library"](https://leanpub.com/b/thetesterslibrary/), (yeah, it wasn't just me giving an HP kind of name to the post to draw attention, it’s the actual name). The library is packed with books such as the following ones:

- Perfect Software and Other Illusions About Testing
- Are Your Lights On: How to Know What the Problem Really Is
- Handbook of Technical Reviews (4th edition)
- General Systems Thinking: An Introduction
- What Did You Say?: The Art of Giving and Receiving Feedback
- More Secrets of Consulting: The Consultant’s Tool Kit
- Becoming a Technical Leader
- The Aremac Project

In the event you do not happen to know who is the author, do not worry, there’s still time to becoming familiar with this experienced professional and author, just click on any of the following links to get a glimpse at him and his work:

- [Gerald M. Weinberg’s Official Site](http://www.geraldmweinberg.com/Site/Home.html)
- [Description and Books on Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/u/jerryweinberg)
- [A biography of the author](http://www.smashwords.com/profile/view/JerryWeinberg)
- [His twitter account](https://twitter.com/jerryweinberg)

To sum up, if you make up your mind to either buy any of those books, do not just read the book, do not limit yourself to that activity alone, instead, do yourself a favour and focus on enjoying it while learning, and learn from it as much as possible.

Last, yet not least, let me share another quote with you:

>"Any fool can know. The point is to understand."
― Albert Einstein

¡Enjoy your reading… enjoy your learning!
