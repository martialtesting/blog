Wow, it has been quite a long time since we last wrote anything at all, this post will be brief, all we want to do is let you know that we are back and eager to start sharing and getting feedback from you.

Plenty of things have happened since the last time we were active, but excuses aside, we now want once again, to start giving value to the testing community, sharing our experiences, sharing our points of view, whilst at the same time getting feedback.

Testing, whatever its flavour, it's something we definitely love and feel passionate about, we want to share that passion with all of you.

Read you all in the following post! :)
