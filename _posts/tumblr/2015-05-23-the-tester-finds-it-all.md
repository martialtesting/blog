Not long ago, I came across with a very funny song, which, for some reason(s) seems dead accurate.

![Finds it all](/assets/error.jpg)


It is interpreted by [Vagif Abilov](https://twitter.com/ooobject), and the video is available in the [following link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TBzP0baOBM), and it belongs to a publication of [Agile Testing Days](http://www.agiletestingdays.com). 

Read through the lyrics and share your thoughts.


>I don’t want a bug
>
>To be defined as feature
>
>Though it’s hurting me
>
>We won’t release this week
>
>
>I’ve had all bad luck
>
>It will surely teach me
>
>Nothing more to say
>
>No more sprints to save
>
>
>The tester finds it all
>
>The error is to fall
>
>I tried to do my best
>
>Just one failing test
>
>
>I was flying high
>
>The algorithm was clever
>
>Fastest you have seen
>
>Written whole in "C"
>
>
>Written whole at night
>
>I won’t do this ever
>
>I was such a fool
>
>Should have learned the rules
>
>
>The prospects were so clean
>
>It worked on my machine
>
>How could I even think
>
>They‘d test with empty string!
>
>
>The tester finds it all
>
>The bug won’t cross the wall
>
>It’s simple and it’s plain
>
>Why should I complain?
>
>
>But tell me how it feels
>
>When you find my error?
>
>Does it feel the same
>
>When it’s him to blame?
>
>
>I don’t really think
>
>I’m a nasty fellow
>
>But what can I say?
>
>The rules must be obeyed
>
>
>Stakeholders will decide
>
>Developers abide
>
>The product will release
>
>The user’s not at risk
>
>
>QA is on again
>
>Co-worker or a friend
>
>Big failure or a small
>
>The tester finds it all
>
>
>I don’t want a bug
>
>To be defined as feature
>
>And I understand
>
>Things are not as planned
>
>
>I apologize
>
>For those little creatures
>
>Also known as bugs
>
>But let us face the fact
>
>
>The tester finds it all...
>
>The tester finds it all...
>
>
>Tester finds it
>
>Bugs won’t hurt us
>
>Team will fix them
>
>Product will ship
>
>
>It was pleasure
>
>Having you here
>
>Hope to see you
>
>In the next year


So, what do you think about the lyrics in the song? Which part of it did you like? Would you add anything to it? Do you not agree with it? I would like to read your thoughts about it.

¡Have fun **#testing**!
