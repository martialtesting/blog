Hello! How is it going? Today I’d like sharing some awesome news.

As you can see by the post’s title as well as the picture, we have begun working collaboratively with other like-minded professionals towards the making of [TestingAR Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/TestingAR/). It all comes about as the initiative of a group of passionate people who are keen on making a difference, as well as on promoting the creation of a solid community with a meeting place.

Its purpose will rely upon bringing together the community more regularly so that we can share our experiences, success stories, lessons learned, tools employed, methodologies and good practices, among other topics. Furthermore, having a place where we can meet, discuss topics, and grow together will also help in building confidence, as well as strengthening bonds among participants.

Nowadays, we are aiming at holding our very first meetup on February 2016, the date has not been set yet, though it will be available soon. It will be a moment for exchange, so stay tuned for more information.

Last, yet not least!! It will also be the perfect excuse to get together and meet in the flesh with other colleagues, and share some good talks in a relaxed environment.
