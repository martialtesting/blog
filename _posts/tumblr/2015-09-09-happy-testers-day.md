Hello to everyone!

Wow, once again it sure has been quite a long time since we last shared something with the community, and what better day to make a comeback than today?

For those of you who may not know, today it is September, Tuesday the 9th, and that means we are celebrating the International Day of the Software Tester, so if you are engaged in this awesome craft… cheers for you!

Without further ado, and because knowing a little history helps us know and understand where we are, and also, helps us plan where we should head to, we’d like sharing a little history

![Happy Testers Day](/assets/happy.jpg)

It dates back to 1947, whilst the team in charge of working on the Mark II computer, which would come as the successor to the ASCC Mark I, shared their discovery of what would become the first report of an error caused by a bug, and in that case, an actual bug. Apparently, the supercomputer had a problem in an electromagnetic relay, and when the problem was investigated, the team came across that the problem was being caused by a moth, its presence in the supercomputer was causing the relay to stay open.

One of the team members, Grace Murray Hopper, Degree in Physics and Mathematics, came across with the moth, and thereafter “reported it” (so to speak) by sticking it with tape on a log referring to it as “bug” to describe the cause of the problem.

On the other hand, if we go to another time in history, we can find that Thomas Alva Edison had used the term “bug” in some of his notes on interference and malfunction. However, it is Grace Murray Hopper who is known as having associated the term for the first time with computers, and having written in the log “First actual case of bug being found”.

Whatever the case, it was our intent wishing all of our colleagues a very happy day!
