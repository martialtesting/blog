Last week, on April the 13th and April the 14th took place one of the most important events in terms of software testing, I am talking about the [Testing UY 2](http://www.testing.uy), and just like with its first edition I had the chance to attend it.

This edition differentiated from its predecessor in several points. Some of which:

- It was held throughout two days, the first one solely dedicated to workshops, whereas the second day was dedicated to conferences;
- On top of that, it also took place in two different locations:
  * Day One (the workshops) took place at [Universidad Católica del Uruguay](http://www.ucu.edu.uy/) (a.k.a. UCUDAL);
  * Day Two (the conferences) were once again held at [Facultad de Ingeniería](http://www.fing.edu.uy/) (a.k.a. FING).
- Now that I think about it, I’d like to know one thing:
Was the event named after Testing UY 2 because it was its second edition? Or was it named like that because the entire event took 2 days? Hmmm… I wonder.
- Anyhow, and moving forward, apart from that, there were several topics throughout the conferences, some of which were related to:
  * Automation,
  * Usability,
  * Moving from Waterfall to Agile with Scrum,
  * Security Testing - OWASP Top 10,
  * Social Responsibility and Educational projects, and [some more which can still be reached at the official site](http://www.testing.uy).
  * One more thing, unlike the first edition of the event, this year had the participation of 2 international speakers. (See? Another occurrence with the number 2.)

From my perspective, all of the previous points ultimately portray something greater, and that is the sense of community. Getting people together, from different backgrounds, with different experiences, levels of knowledge, lines of thought, lines of work, etc., etc., all together with one common goal, sharing and learning about testing.

Having that said, are there opportunities for improvements? Yes! Of course there are! And you know what? That’s a **great** thing! It means that there are new challenges to face. Yet ultimately, those challenges will open more opportunities to the community, so they bring about ideas, new conferences, suggestions for improvements, events of the sort need involvement and participation.

On the other hand, it is important to notice that this is just the second edition of the event, and it already differs in a most positive manner from the previous event.

All in all, I must say that it was rewarding in several aspects. Not only was it a great moment to meet new people, and to learn from the experiences as well as challenges from other colleagues, but also, it was a moment to share with like-minded people, and more importantly, to meet with old friends again.

A huge kudos to all those who made this year’s event possible, **sponsors, supporters, organisers**, and of course, to all the testers who attended it.

¡Looking forward to the next year’s event!

P.S.: In case you would like to know about the activity of the event that went on in twitter, just go to the [TestingUY channel in twitter](https://twitter.com/testinguy).

P.S.2: As a side note, [a huge token of appreciation to whomever took a picture of me depicting my non-stop progressive baldness...](http://www.testing.uy/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/charlas-testinguy-2015-24.jpg) I’m so very happy that someone captured it… not -_-
