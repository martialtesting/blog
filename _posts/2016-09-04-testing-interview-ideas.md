During the last years I usually had some kind of checklist/spreadsheet with **testing job interview** questions and ideas. Since that
time I had in mind to create an easy to navigate mindmap to go through during the interview and take notes. After some discussions
in [testers.io](http://www.testers.io/) about hiring and some articles shared there by their writters: [Sheree Pennah](https://gist.github.com/pennah/b551d1c0e74483c09df5259c35c779c1) and
[Dan Ashby](https://danashby.co.uk/2015/12/07/how-i-interview-testers/) I felt motivated to put all the things together and create that mindmap :)

If anyone wants the original file to open in [mindmup](https://www.mindmup.com), just ping me at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nachoesmite) or any other medium :)

**The lack of color in the mindmap is b/c I use a state plugin to add colors during the interview ;)**
